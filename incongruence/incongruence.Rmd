Internode certainty and related measures (Salichos and Rokas 2013; Kobert et al. 2016) have proven to be powerful
methods to examine bipartition support. This has proven to be especially true when bootstrap values become unreliable
(e.g., when an input alignment is very long).

In this practical, we will learn how to calculate internode certainty and related measures to examine bipartition
support and support for alternative topologies. We will be examining the relationships between filamentous fungi
known to be medically and technologically significant. More specifically, we will be examining the relationships
among *Aspergillus*, *Penicillium*, *Monascus*, *Xeromyces*, *Penicilliopsis*, and outgroup taxa (*Uncinocarpus reesii* and
*Coccidioides posadasii*) using phylogenies from [Steenwyk et al. (2019) *mBio*](https://jlsteenwyk.com/publication_pdfs/2019_Steenwyk_et_al_mBio.pdf).

Note, steps within objectives that have fill-in-the-blank prompts are indicated as such using `r colorize("blue", "blue")`
color font. Please fill in these prompts.
Additionally, if the software you are trying to use isnâ€™t in your path, it is likely in `~/software`.

# Protocol {-}

This objective is divided in seven parts:

* Download and examine the dataset 
* How to collapse branches by a support threshold
* Prepare the necessary input files and calculate internode certainty and related measures
* Identify bipartitions with low internode certainty values
* Determine gene support frequency and concordance factors for the reference and alternative topology at the contentious internode
* Calculate gene-wise and site-wise phylogenetic signal
* BONUS challenge

As noted above, the dataset for this practical comes from [Steenwyk et al. (2019) *mBio*](https://jlsteenwyk.com/publication_pdfs/2019_Steenwyk_et_al_mBio.pdf).

<br>

## 1. Download and examine the dataset 

1.  With your Guacamole terminal download the data set, which is available here:
[https://github.com/JLSteenwyk/2024_phylogenomics_workshop/raw/main/incongruence/confidence_measures.tar.gz](https://github.com/JLSteenwyk/2024_phylogenomics_workshop/raw/main/incongruence/confidence_measures.tar.gz)

Hint:
```{bash, eval=F}
$ wget http://...
```

2. Confirm that you have downloaded the tar zipped directory `confidence_measures.tar.gz`
3. Unzip the directory

Hint:
```{bash, eval=F}
# the command is 'tar' ("tape archive")
```

Solution:
```{bash, eval=F}
$ tar -zxvf confidence_measures.tar.gz
```

4. Change directory into the newly unzipped directory
5. Examine the contents of the directory using the `ls` command
6. `r colorize("How many files are in confidence_measures?", "blue")`
7. `r colorize("Is standard RAxML installed (i.e., not RAxML-NG)?", "blue")` If not, execute the following code and keep in mind the path to executables:

```{bash, eval=F}
git clone https://github.com/stamatak/standard-RAxML.git
cd standard-RAxML
make -f Makefile.gcc
cd ..
```

<br>

## 2. How to collapse branches by a support threshold
As described in the lecture, it can be helpful to collapse poorly support branches before, for example, species tree infernece using summary tree methods.
Collapsing poorly supported branches can help account for gene tree uncertainty because the summary tree methods assume gene trees are otherwise
accurate. To do so, we will use the PhyKIT function [collapse_branches](https://jlsteenwyk.com/PhyKIT/usage/index.html#collapse-bipartitions).

Steps:
1. Change directory into `FILES_collapsing_across_thresholds`.
2. Write a nested for loop and collapse the branches of each phylogenetic tree with thresholds of 80, 70, and 60 using the [collapse_branches](https://jlsteenwyk.com/PhyKIT/usage/index.html#collapse-bipartitions) function.

Solution
```{bash, eval=F}
for j in $(echo "60 70 80"); do for i in $(ls *treefile) ; do echo $i $j ; pk_collapse_branches $i -s $j -o $i.${j}collapsed ; done ; done
```

3. Count the number of internal branches in each file and each threshold (including no collapsing) using a nested `for` loop. Make the output be nicely. 

Hint
```{bash, eval=F}
# The first question is how do we count internal branches in a phylogenetic tree? 
# I know an indirect way we can do this using the `internal_branch_stats` function of PhyKIT.

# PhyKIT functions that print out summary statistics (mean, medians, etc.) have a verbose option, -v/--verbose.
# When using the verbose option, raw data is outputted instead. Thus, we can obtain internal branch length information
# using the `internal_branch_stats` function but use the verbose option (-v/--verbose) and get the length of each internal branch.
# Thereafter, we can count how many internal branches there are and calculate the difference to see how many were collapsed.
```

Solution
```{bash, eval=F}
# copy and paste this one-liner
echo -e "file\tthreshold\tBranch cnt-uncoll\tBranch cnt-coll\tNum. collapsed branches" ; for i in *treefile ; do cnt=$(pk_internal_branch_stats $i -v | wc -l) ; for j in $(echo "60 70 80"); do coll_cnt=$(pk_internal_branch_stats $i.${j}collapsed -v | wc -l) ; num_coll=$(expr $cnt - $coll_cnt) ; echo -e "$i\t$j\t$cnt\t$coll_cnt\t$num_coll" ; done ; done

# one-liner written out as more readable with comments so you can better understand
echo -e "file\tthreshold\tBranch cnt-uncoll\tBranch cnt-coll\tNum. collapsed branches" ; 
for i in *treefile ; do
  cnt=$(pk_internal_branch_stats $i -v | wc -l) # count internal branches in the uncollapsed case
  for j in $(echo "60 70 80"); do
    coll_cnt=$(pk_internal_branch_stats $i.${j}collapsed -v | wc -l) # count internal branches in the collapsed case
    num_coll=$(expr $cnt - $coll_cnt) # substract the collapsed number of internal branches from the uncollapsed number of internal branches 
    echo -e "$i\t$j\t$cnt\t$coll_cnt\t$num_coll"
  done ;
done

file	threshold	Branch cnt-uncoll	Branch cnt-coll	Num. collapsed branches
OG0002050.fa.mafft.clipkit.treefile	60	21	20	1
OG0002050.fa.mafft.clipkit.treefile	70	21	20	1
OG0002050.fa.mafft.clipkit.treefile	80	21	17	4
OG0002051.fa.mafft.clipkit.treefile	60	21	19	2
OG0002051.fa.mafft.clipkit.treefile	70	21	18	3
OG0002051.fa.mafft.clipkit.treefile	80	21	14	7
OG0002053.fa.mafft.clipkit.treefile	60	21	20	1
OG0002053.fa.mafft.clipkit.treefile	70	21	20	1
OG0002053.fa.mafft.clipkit.treefile	80	21	19	2
```

where

* column 1: Tree being examined
* column 2: Collapsing threshold
* column 3: Number of internal branches in uncollapsed tree
* column 4: Number of internal branches in collapsed tree
* column 5: The number of collapsed branches

4. `r colorize("Which tree had the most branches collapsed and under what collapsing threshold?", "blue")`
Solution
```{bash, eval=F}
OG0002051.fa.mafft.clipkit.treefile had 7 branches that were collapsed
```

5. Examine the tree in `OG0002051.fa.mafft.clipkit.treefile.70collapsed`. 
`r colorize("Are shallow or deep branches collapsed? Why is your answer more likely to be collapsed?", "blue")`

Hint
```{bash, eval=F}
# This command allows you to quickly view a phylogenetic tree in the terminal by printing a tree in ASCII characters.
pk_print_tree OG0002051.fa.mafft.clipkit.treefile.70collapsed -r

# the -r argument removes branch length information making it easier to see which branches got collapsed
```

Solution
```{bash, eval=F}
Often, deeper branches in a phylogeny will have lower support values because more ancient divergences are more difficult to accurately infer. Thus, deeper, not shallower, branches are more likely to be collapsed.
```

<br>

## 3. Prepare the necessary input files and calculate internode certainty and related measures

* The necessary input files to calculate internode certainty using RAxML include the putative species tree and evaluation trees.
* The species tree has been provided and is named Asp_Pen_phylo.subset.new. It contains a subset group of eleven taxa from the original 82 taxa dataset [Steenwyk et al. (2019) *mBio*](https://jlsteenwyk.com/publication_pdfs/2019_Steenwyk_et_al_mBio.pdf)
* Evaluation trees can be from bootstrap replicates or single gene phylogenies; the latter of which is more common. In either case, the file containing evaluation trees will have one phylogeny in newick format for each line of the evaluation tree file. The evaluation trees are a subset from the original 1,668 data matrix.
 
Steps:

1. Go to your parent directory using the `cd` command: `cd ..`
2. `r colorize("How many single gene trees are in FILES_AA_trees_subset?", "blue")` 
3. Create a file of evaluation trees with the following command:

```{bash, eval=F}
cat FILES_AA_trees_subset/* > 1287.trees
```

4. Calculate values of internode certainty and related measures using the following command:

```{bash, eval=F}
# Note, you may have to provide the full path to raxmlHPC
# The full path may be ./standard-RAxML/raxmlHPC, if you made a local installation in step 1.7.
raxmlHPC -f i -t Asp_Pen_phylo.subset.new -z 1287.trees -m GTRCAT -n Asp_Pen_phylo.ic -C
```

* -f i specifies that calculations of internode certainty, internode certainty all, tree certainty, and tree certainty all will be displayed on a specified input tree.
* the input tree is specified with the -t parameter,
* -z species the evaluation trees,
* -m specifies an arbitrary substitution model (i.e., it has no influence on the results but is a required argument for RAxML to work),
* -n specifies a string given to output, and
* -C will provide a verbose output.

The verbose output provides the user with two additional file types:

* (1) files with the reference and alternative topologies for each bipartition, which is specified in the following syntax of `RAxML_verboseIC.Asp_Pen_phylo.ic.0` ... `RAxML_verboseIC.Asp_Pen_phylo.ic.N-1`
  + where N is the number of bipartitions in a given tree 
* (2) a summary file, `RAxML_verboseSplits.Asp_Pen_phylo.ic`, of various topologies, gene support frequencies, and internode certainty values for each bipartition.
* Other output files include
  + an information file, `RAxML_info.Asp_Pen_phylo.ic`, which contains details about the RAxML run, 
  + `RAxML_IC_Score_BranchLabels.Asp_Pen_phylo.ic`, which contains the input tree with internode certainty and internode certainty all values on the tree represented as branch labels.

5. Examine the contents of the information file, `RAxML_info.Asp_Pen_phylo.ic`. Determine the tree certainty and relative tree certainty value using the following commands:

```{bash, eval=F}
grep "Tree certainty\|Relative tree" RAxML_info.Asp_Pen_phylo.ic
```

where grep searches for the string â€˜Tree certaintyâ€™ and â€˜Relative treeâ€™ in `RAxML_info.Asp_Pen_phylo.ic`. In `Tree certainty\|Relative tree` of the grep command, the `\|` specifies to search for the string â€˜Tree certaintyâ€™ and â€˜Relative treeâ€™ thereby allowing you to search for multiple strings in one command.


6. `r colorize("What are the follows of the following metrics?", "blue")`
* Tree certainty value.
* Relative tree certainty.
* Tree certainty all including all conflicting bipartitions.
* Relative tree certainty all including all conflicting bipartitions.

<br>

## 4. Identify bipartitions with low internode certainty values

To examine internode certainty values among bipartitions in our putative species tree,
we will first execute a script that replaces bootstrap values with internode support values
and forgo examination of internode certainty all values. We will then view the tree in
FigTree or similar software. Note, if you'd like to use a webservice like [phylo.io](https://phylo.io/),
you can `cat` the tree file and copy and paste the resulting text into the `Tree data` box on the [phylo.io](https://phylo.io/)
website.

Steps:

1. To report internode certainty values as support values, we will use the file `FILES_scripts_and_matrices/report_ic_as_internode_support.py`.
To understand how to use the script, execute the following command: 

```{bash, eval=F}
python FILES_scripts_and_matrices/report_ic_as_internode_support.py -h
```

2. Based on the help message printed from the previous command, execute the script on the following tree
`RAxML_IC_Score_BranchLabels.Asp_Pen_phylo.ic` to report internode certainty values as support values.

Solution
```{bash, eval=F}
python FILES_scripts_and_matrices/report_ic_as_internode_support.py -t RAxML_IC_Score_BranchLabels.Asp_Pen_phylo.ic
```

3. Open up the resulting file, `RAxML_IC_Score_BranchLabels.Asp_Pen_phylo.ic.ic.tree`, using FigTree or your preferred tree viewer.

4. In [Steenwyk et al. (2019) *mBio*](https://jlsteenwyk.com/publication_pdfs/2019_Steenwyk_et_al_mBio.pdf), we further
scrutinized bipartitions with internode certainty values <0.1. Our reasoning is that internodes with this value or
lower have ~5 evaluation trees that support the reference topology and ~2 or more phylogenies that support an alternative
topology - we consider this substantial incongruence.

5. Identify the internode with an internode certainty below 0.1 and specify the value and which internode that is in the
phylogeny below. Note, you will have midpoint root the phylogeny first, or place the root at ancestor of *U. reesii* and *C. posadasii*.

```{r, echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("/Users/jacoblsteenwyk/Desktop/2024_phylogenomics_workshop/incongruence/phylo.png")
```

Solution:
```{bash, eval=F}
The branch at the ancestor of M. ruber and P. camemberti has a low IC value.
```

## 5. Determine gene support frequency and concordance factors for the reference and alternative topology at the contentious internode

* To determine gene support frequency, we will use RAxML. Note, you have previously calculate gene support frequencies with PhyKIT when you used the `pk_ptt` function.
* To determine concordance factors, we will use IQ-Tree.

Steps:

1. Examine the verboseSplits output from RAxML, which is file `RAxML_verboseSplits.Asp_Pen_phylo.ic`

2. The bipartition for the contentious internode of question is second to last instance of the string â€˜partition:â€™, which appears as the following:
  partition:

  \-\-\-** ***** *      xx/yy/zz <br>
  \-\-*-\- ***** *      xx/yy/zz <br>
  \-\-*** \-\-\-\-\- -      xx/yy/zz <br>

where `xx/yy/zz` represents the following:

* xx: the number of genes that support a given bipartition,
* yy: the gene support frequency of the given bipartition, and
â€¢Â zz: the internode certainty value for the given internode.

We will focus on the first two topologies which consider whether
the genus *Penicilliopsis* is more closely related to outgroup taxa
or if *Xeromyces* and *Monascus* is. In other words, which
genus/genera *Penicilliopsis* or *Xeromyces* and *Monascus* is sister
to all other members of this fungal family?

`r colorize("What is the number of genes and gene support frequency that support the two topologies?", "blue")`

Solution:
```{bash, eval=F}
First topology:
375/29.137529

Second topology:
340/26.418026
```

3. Now, calculate gene and site concordance factors in the following single command.

```{bash, eval=F}
iqtree2 -t Asp_Pen_phylo.subset.new --gcf 1287.trees --scf 100 -p FILES_AA_fastas_subset/ --prefix gcf1297_scf100_ref
```
where:

* -t specifies the putative species tree,
* \-\-gcf represents the 1287.trees observed single gene trees,
* \-\-scf 100 represents that 100 quartets will be randomly for each internal branch for computing site concordance factors, 
* -p specifies the directory that has the single gene fasta files, and
* \-\-prefix specifies the prefix of the output files.

4. There are four resulting files:
* a log file,
* a cf.tree file with gene concordance factors,
* a cf.branch file with internal branch identifiers, and
* a cf.stat file with tab-separated values of gene and site concordance as well as gene and site discordance factors for each internode.

For now, we will focus on gene and site concordance factors.

5. Reexamine the contentious bipartition in the `gcf1297_scf100_ref.cf.tree` file, which can be viewed in FigTree or similar software.
`r colorize("What is the gene concordance and site concordance factor for the contentious bipartition?", "blue")`

Solution:
```{bash, eval=F}
0.155/32.1
```

6. Conduct the same analysis using the alternative topology as an input by executing the following command:

```{bash, eval=F}
iqtree2 -t Asp_Pen_phylo.subset.alt.new --gcf 1287.trees --scf 100 -p FILES_AA_fastas_subset/ --prefix gcf1297_scf100_alt
```

7. Examine the contentious bipartition where *Penicilliopsis zonata* splits from *Aspergillus* and *Penicillium* in file
`gcf1297_scf100_alt.cf.tree`. What is the gene concordance factor and site concordance factor for this bipartition?

Solution:
```{bash, eval=F}
0/36.2
```

## 6. Calculate gene-wise and site-wise phylogenetic signal
To determine gene-wise and site-wise phylogenetic signal, we will follow protocol first described in 
[Shen et al. (2017), Nature Ecology and Evolution](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0126)
and calculate gene-wise and site-wise log-likelihood scores. We will use IQ-Tree to facilitate the analysis.

Steps:

1. Calculating gene-wise and site-wise log-likelihood scores takes too much time â€“ **so do not execute the following commands**.
The following commands are provided because I wanted you to have access and an understanding of how the results files
you will be using were created.

```{bash, eval=F}
# Command 1
iqtree2 -s FILES_scripts_and_matrices/concat.fa -seed 78913467814 -st AA -pre likelihood_ref -spp FILES_scripts_and_matrices/partition.file -te Asp_Pen_phylo.subset.new -wpl -wsl

# Command 2
iqtree2 -s concatenation.fasta -seed 13469781343 -st AA -pre likelihood_alt -spp partition.file -te FILES_GLS_files/concatenation.alt.topology -wpl -wsl
```

2. `r colorize("In the previous two commands, what do the following specify?", "blue")`
Hint, it will be useful to use their documentation â€“ see [http://www.iqtree.org/doc/Command-Reference](http://www.iqtree.org/doc/Command-Reference).

* -spp
* -te
* -wpl
* -wsl

3. Create summary files with gene-wise and site-wise log likelihood scores using a custom script provided for you.
To do so, first change directories into FILES_gene_and_site_lh_values with the following command:

```{bash, eval=F}
cd FILES_gene_and_site_lh_values
```

Next examine how to use the script that will create summary files for you using the following command:
```{bash, eval=F}
bash ../FILES_scripts_and_matrices/create_GLS_summary.sh -h
```

Based on the help message, create gene-wise and site-wise log likelihood score summary files using the following command:
```{bash, eval=F}
bash ../FILES_scripts_and_matrices/create_GLS_summary.sh ../FILES_scripts_and_matrices/partition.file likelihood_ref.partlh likelihood_alt.partlh likelihood_ref.sitelh likelihood_alt.sitelh
```

4. We will now examine the contents of gene-wise_logli_scores.txt and site-wise_logli_scores.txt.
To do so, we will plot the results from each file in R using ggplot2. First, start a session in R by
typing R in the terminal and load ggplot2 using the following command:

```{r, eval=F}
library(ggplot2)
```

If you are not in the working directory with your results files, use `setwd('path')` to change to the
appropriate directory. Make sure you are in the appropriate directory with the `getwd()` command.

5. Next, read in the data tables using the following command:

```{r, eval=F}
gene<-read.table("gene-wise_logli_scores.txt", sep = "\t")
```
where

* read.table() is an R function to read in a table or text file and
* sep = "\t" specifies that the table is tab (or "\t") delimited.

6. Make a plot of the gene-wise log likelihood scores using the following command:
```{r, eval=F}
ggplot(gene, aes(V1, V4, color=V5)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") + ggtitle("GLS (gene-wise)") +
  xlab("Genes") + ylab("deltaGLS") + theme_classic() +
  theme(axis.text.x=element_blank(), axis.ticks.x=element_blank()) +
  scale_color_manual(values=c("#56B4E9", "#999999", "#E69F00"))
```

7. There is one gene with overwhelming phylogenetic signal. To determine what gene this is,
sort the data stored as gene according to the column of Î”GLS values using the following command
and examine the fourth column, which is Î”GLS:

```{r, eval=F}
head(gene[order(-gene$V4),])
```

8. `r colorize("What gene has a high Î”GLS in favor of the reference topology?", "blue")`

Solution
```{bash, eval=F}
EOG091N0K4M has a Î”GLS of 113.180
```

9. To determine if removing this gene will switch the topology at the given internode,
calculate the sum of log likelihood values after removing the gene-wise log likelihood score for this gene.
To do so, execute the following command:
```{r, eval=F}
sum(gene[(gene$V4!= 113.180),]$V4)
```
where

* `sum()` will calculate the sum of a set of numbers and
* `gene[(gene$V4!=113.180),]$V4` will print the set of numbers excluding the highly opinionated gene.


10. `r colorize("Does the topology change if you remove this gene?", "blue")`

Solution
```{bash, eval=F}
sum w/ 400.72
sum w/out 287.54

No, because the sum of phylogenetic signal is still (+).
```

11. Repeat v and vi for site-wise_logli_scores.txt by executing the following commands:

```{r, eval=F}
# read in site-wise log likelihood scores file
site<-read.table("site-wise_logli_scores.txt", sep = "\t")
# create plot
ggplot(site, aes(V1, V4, color=V5)) + geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  ggtitle("SLS (site-wise)") + xlab("Sites") + ylab("deltaSLS") +
  theme_classic() + theme(axis.text.x=element_blank(), axis.ticks.x=element_blank()) +
  scale_color_manual(values=c("#56B4E9", "#999999", "#E69F00"))
```

12. `r colorize("Is there one site with overwhelming signal?", "blue")`

Solution
```{r, eval=F}
No
```

## 7. Bonus
1. Using only starting data of gene trees, use internode certainty (and/or related measures) to rank the following datasets from most consistent among single-gene trees to least.
The four datasets are: 
* Eutheria, a lineage of mammals,
* budding yeasts,
* filamentous fungi, and
* mammals

<br>

Light hints for overall workflow
```{bash, eval=F}
1. You will have to infer a summary tree (aka, species tree estimate) first. How do you infer a species tree from a collection of single gene trees?

2. Use the PhyKIT function `bipartition_support_stats` to get summary statistics support statistics in a phylogeny. Support statistics have to be reported in the position bootstrap statistics are reported.
```

<br>

Detailed hints for overall workflow
```{bash, eval=F}
1. To do so, first infer a summary tree using ASTRAL and then use the input trees as evaluation trees to calculate internode certainty and related measures in RAxML.
java -jar astral.jar -i all_trees.tre -o output_tree

2. Calculate internode certainty
raxmlHPC -f i -t output_tree -z all_trees.tre -m GTRCAT -n output_tree.ic -C

3. Use `report_ic_as_internode_support.py` to reformat IC values as bootstrap values

4. Use the PhyKIT function `bipartition_support_stats` to get summary statistics of internode certainty values across the tree
# https://jlsteenwyk.com/PhyKIT/usage/index.html#bipartition-support-statistics
phykit bipartition_support_stats input.tree

5. Keep track of your summary statistic of choice across each dataset and rank the datasets by which has the most to least certainty.
```

<br>

Solution
```{bash, eval=F}
Gotcha!!!!

No solution will be provided here. Grab a TA, discuss with them and show them your results.
```

2. For each dataset, calculate summary statistics of internode certainty (or related measures) between SC-OGs and SNAP-OGs.
How is certainity similar or different between SC-OGs and SNAP-OGs?

Solution
```{bash, eval=F}
Gotcha again!!!!

No solution will be provided here. Grab a TA, discuss with them and show them your results.
